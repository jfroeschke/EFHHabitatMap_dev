    <p id="first">An essential fish habitat (EFH) consultation is the process used by federal agencies and
the National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA Fisheries) to protect and conserve habitats
determined to be especially important to commercial and recreational marine fish and
shellfish.</p>

<hr>
<h3>Why is an EFH Consultation Required?</h3>
<br>
<p id="consult">In the Magnuson-Stevens Act Congress declared, “One of the greatest long-term threats to the viability of
commercial and recreational fisheries is the continuing loss of marine, estuarine and other aquatic habitats.
Habitat considerations should receive increased attention for the conservation and management of fishery
resources of the United States.” The Act defined EFH as “those waters and substrate necessary to fish for
spawning, breeding, feeding, or growth to maturity.” In 2002, NOAA Fisheries issued final regulations
establishing procedures for identifying and describing EFH in federal fishery management plans.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Who determines what habitat is identified as EFH?</h3>
<br>
<p id="consult">Regional Fishery Management Councils (Councils) are responsible for determining what habitats meet the
definition of EFH for fish and shellfish species managed under their jurisdiction. Three Councils occur in the
Southeast United States: the Gulf of Mexico, South Atlantic, and U.S. Caribbean. NOAA Fisheries must
ensure EFH designations comply with the regulations when approving fishery management plans. NOAA
Fisheries is responsible for identifying and describing EFH in fishery management plans for highly migratory
species which cross Council boundaries, such as sharks, tunas, and billfish.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Do I have to consult with NOAA Fisheries?</h3>
<br>
<p id="consult">Federal agencies have the sole responsibility to consult with NOAA Fisheries, if the federal agency
determines their activity or action may adversely affect EFH. In the Southeast U.S. the majority of EFH
consultations are conducted by the district offices of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in association with
their regulatory authorities over wetlands and navigable waters of the U.S. and their civil works programs.
Other federal agencies which frequently consult with NOAA Fisheries in the Southeast include: the U.S.
Coast Guard, Federal Highways Administration, Environmental Protection Agency, Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management, and Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Who do I Contact?</h3>
<br>
<p id="consult">Because habitat conservation requirements vary from site to site, determinations made by NMFS Habitat Conservation Division field biologists familiar with local and regional habitat requirements of living marine resources may differ from the guidance documents. The Habitat Conservation Division has offices throughout the southeast United States. It is usually best to call the office in your state if you have a question about a specific project or area in the Southeast Region.</p>
